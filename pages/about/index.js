            <p className="text-md lg:text-xl mb-2">
              When I was 15, I wrote my first line of code and was immediately
              hooked on the world of software development. I spent countless
              hours learning and experimenting with different programming
              languages and techniques, and I quickly became proficient in a
              number of different languages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md lg:text-xl mb-2">
              At 19, I decided to switch my career path to design, and I spent
              the next few years honing my skills in visual design and user
              experience. I worked on a number of different projects, and I
              learned a lot about creating beautiful and intuitive designs that
              resonated with users.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md lg:text-xl mb-2">
              However, after a few years, I realized that my true passion was in
              coding, and I decided to switch back to a career in software
              development. I spent the next few years learning and growing as a
              developer, and I eventually landed a job as a front-end developer.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md lg:text-xl">
              Now, with 3 years of experience under my belt, I am constantly
              striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest
              technologies and best practices in the field. I am passionate
              about creating user-friendly and engaging experiences through the
              development of effective user interfaces.
